# WifiBarcodeSample
Sample code for my article in DotNetCurry magazine on scanning barcodes. In this sample you can generate and scan QR codes that contain a Wi-Fi connection string.

More information on the Wi-Fi connection string can be found here: https://qifi.org/

The article is to be published at this time.
